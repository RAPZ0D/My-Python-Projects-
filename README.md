## About Me
I am currently a student, studying Data Science and I have completed my studies in AI, my goal here is to share my project work so that anyone can view it access it and modify it 

## Features

Highlight the key features or functionalities of your project.

- This is an introduction of the python coding projects that I have completed
- This area has focused on the basics of python from the data structures to the AI part of the project, since I am currently focused on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence 

## Installation
There are a of packages that I have installed using all my assignments  if you have any issues you can view it here and download it 
pip install your_package_name ( this is how you install your packages in python) 
Libraries I have used is : 
1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. seaborn
4. pandas
5. yfinance
6. geopandas
7. geopy
8. my-sql-connector python
9. nltk
10. psycopg2
11. requests
12. sqlalchemy
13. tqdm
14. tweepy

You can find these libraries using the PYPI Python Package installer [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)

## API 
I have used different API's for my labs I can share you some of the links where you can read the documentaion and access the api keys, read the documentation well because sometimes you can use their demo api key to see how it actually works 

[Alpha Vantage Documentation](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)

[World Bank Documents API](https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/api)

[Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/)

[OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

[NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/)

[News API](https://newsapi.org/)

[Dog CEO Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)


## Lab 1
My Lab 1 python file consists of basic math questions performed on python, the contents are mentioned below: 
1. Pallindrome
2. Common elements between 2 lists
3. Temperature in Farenheit to Celcius
4. GCD Greatest Common Divisor
5. Fibonacci Series
6. Shortest distance between two points
7. Area of the circle rectangle and triangle using def function
8. ATM machine

## Lab 2  
The Lab 2 exercises are again to test basic function calls and math functions, inluding the Object Oriented Pogramming part, also using Modules to call the function from multiple python libraries. The programs that are in the Lab 2 are: 
1. Functions (List even numbers)
2. Functions(Area of the triangle)
3. Functions (Celcius to Farehneit)
4. Functions (GCD)
5. OOP (shape of the Rectqangle and Circle
6. OOP (Animal Brid or Mammal)
7. Modules ( Basic Arithmetic Operations)
8. Modules (API request)
9. Modules ( string_utils)
10. Modules (File Operations)

## Lab 3
The Lab 3 focuses on API (Application Programming Interface) here I have used the Openweather API to get the Weather and other outputs relating weather conditions of different cities. This application requires an API to to work so if you would need to know how to get one access the link
[OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
In this lab I have performed the tasks mentioned below: 
1. Getting the sunrise and sunset of a city where the user inputs the city
2. Weather Comparison Tool Part 1
3. Weather Comparison Tool Part 2
 You can refer the juypter notebook to view the outptus of the code 

## Lab 4 
In Lab 4 I have focused on connecting to a SQL server using python, for this lab I have used postgres, but you can use any SQL tool that you like. By using the psycopg library I provide the login credentials and connect it.
In the second step I actually get data from the openweather API and then store it in my Database by creating a table using python 
In this Lab I have done: 
1. Connecting to Postgres using the login credintials
2. Accessing the Openweather API
3. Storing the data in the Database by creating a table 

## Lab 5 
Lab 5 focuses on api call, fetching the data from the API and then storing the useful information in our SQL database, by creating a table. In this Lab I have used Openweather API and FakeStore API to get my data. The things that I have Performed in this lab are mentioned below 
1. Getting the users name and the first city
2. Prediction the Temperature of the city
3. Storing the city and the predicted temperature of the city in a Database by creating a table
4. Getting the user profile, email and address, and showing which product has the user viewed and have they purchased the item or not
5. Storing the above functions data in a SQL Database
6. Product Recommendation according to where the user lives and storing the data in the database
7. Creating a live store and where the items are sold they get restocked by adding new items

## Lab 6
In Lab 6 I am making use of the yfinance library (Yahoo Finance) to get the information about stocks and providing visualization and also storing it locally. In this lab what I have done is : 
1. Data retrival ( get the value of different stocks)
2. Save the retrived data locally in the our local computer
3. Displaying the data correctly and providing Average daily return, Volatility and  Correlation between the sotcks
4. Finding the moving average of the stocks
5. Visualizing the socks of Buy signal and Sell signal
6. Portfolio Allocation
7. Risk Return Analysis
8. Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio and Jensen Alpha
9. Providing a line chart visualization
10. Investment Recommendations
11.
